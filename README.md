Hey there, I don't know how to make fancy aesthetic things so this as good as it gets.

- 18 | ♀ | Christian | autistic
- I don't have a DNI list. Just be respectful and we cool.
- I do a lot of drawing and I also animate a bit and make costumes.
- I'm always happy to hear someone out so if you need someone to talk to, I'll listen and give my best advice.

- Also one of special interests at the moment is drawing jojo characters as deer things, as you can see, this reflects on my PonyTown skins.
